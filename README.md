# Everlasting Options Prototype

## Overview
This is a prototype of a decentralized protocol for Everlasting Options, a new type of derivative created by [Dave White](https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_) and [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda). Everlasting options are designed to give traders long-term options exposure without the effort, risk, or expense of rolling positions. 

This prototype is unaudited meant only for demonstration purposes. If you choose to interact with these smart contracts, please do so with the understanding that your assets are at risk of being lost.
